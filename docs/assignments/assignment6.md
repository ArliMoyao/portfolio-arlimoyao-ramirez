November 3, 2024 (Updated Nobember 3, 2024)

| Task Title                | Instruction                                                                 | Rationale                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create an Event           | Create a new event with a title, date, and location.                        | To test the ease of event creation and identify any usability issues in the form-filling process.              |
| RSVP to an Event          | RSVP to an existing event from the event list.                              | To evaluate the clarity and accessibility of the RSVP feature and ensure users can easily join events.         |
| Cancel RSVP               | Cancel your RSVP for an event you previously signed up for.                 | To check the intuitiveness of the cancellation process and ensure users can easily manage their RSVPs.         |
| Upvote an Event           | Upvote an event from the event list.                                        | To assess the visibility and functionality of the upvote feature, ensuring it encourages user interaction.     |
| Use the Search Bar        | Use the search bar to find a specific event by name.                        | To evaluate the search functionality and ensure it helps users quickly find relevant events.                   |


For participant 1, I gave them a brief warning that the functionalties were not fully implemented, and that if they
encountered technical results, to list out their observations of what seems to be working, and not to be working. 

During usability testing, the participant interacted with features like creating events, upvoting, RSVPing, and undoing RSVPs. The "Create Event" button was one of the most intuitive elements, as the participant found it easy to locate and use. Its clear labeling and positioning supported quick access to a primary action. However, while creating an event, the participany struggled to move back and forth within the interface due to  bugs, which caused alot of confusion. This issue likely reflects a gap in the app's navigation flow, where the system's response did not fully align with user expectations.

For the Upvote and RSVP functions, participants had a positive experience overall. When they clicked on these buttons, a notification appeared, confirming their action and creating a sense of trust in the app's response. 

However, when user attempted to undo their RSVP, they noticed that the event was not immediately removed from their list of RSVPed events, which led to some frustration. While the "Undo RSVP" button was easy to find, the lack of immediate response from the system disrupted the experience. The participant expected the event to be removed right after un-RSVPing. There was a lot of moving back and forth between the event tabs because the event rsvp list was not responding. Given that there were technical issues, the issue was not able to navigate clearly as I hoped they would. Overall I noticed a lot of reassurance from the user, and questions being asked due to the technical issues.
