# Assignment 2

## **1. Broad Application Goals** 
- Title: Eventure
- Target Audience: The intended audience are adults of all ages who want to make new friends in a new city, or strengthen their friendships.  They have a desire to explore different hobbies, or passions – within a community.
- Value: The app will foster friendships, and allows for a more interconnected world. With the right precautions, users will gain access to a wide range of events which take place in public spaces. Rather than serving as an application that stays online, this app encourages its users to intermingle offline and bridges the event, logistical planning, and community to one digital space.






## **2. Scrapbook Comparables** 
- Inspiration is take from EventBrite, Facebook, Slack and Discord. 



1. This GIF is from EventBrite that shows how a user can use their current location, or input a location where they desire to see current and upcoming events. This is useful because it can allow users to also see events nearest to them. With an added functionality, we can display this information in map view.

2. This GIF is from EventBrite as well, and shows how a user can create an event if they were to host one. This is useful because my app will also let users create their own event and arrange logistics. Having a component that includes logistics like similar to filling out a form, and assigning a time/date/location are all important considerations.

3. This GIF represents a feature that allows users to buy tickets for events. This functionality– the process of buying tickets, adding a ticket to a cart and checking it out is useful to me because users can buy tickets for events within the groups they join.

4. This GIF represents a feature that allows users of Facebook to invite friends to join certain groups. This functionality is useful because it allows for more user engagement to different communities. Similarly, users will have the option to join as many communities as they would like to.

5. This GIF represents subchannels within a group on Discord that serves as multiple chat rooms with different purposes, and has a multiple subgroup component. This functionality is useful because it allows users to move between various chats of the communities they are a part of. An example chat of a group could similarly be an introduction chat, or announcements chat.

## **3. Brainstorming Feature Ideas (Collaboration with Arzy and Adriana)**  

**Reaction Feature**

- Users can react indirectly to others through subtle actions like liking or engaging with their content such as event posts or pictures. This creates a much more relaxed environment where users can connect on shared interests.

**Event Radar with Nearby Features**

- This feature helps users by suggesting hangouts and activities happening nearby based on the user’s location. This can encourage users to attend more events leisurely. 

**Ice breaker Prompts and Challenges**

- Within groups or events, users can be given fun conversation starters when entering a chat regarding the specific niche or interest. Another fun feature would be incorporating challenges, encouraging users to participate in many different events. 

**Karma Points System for Event Participation**

- Users can earn points based on their interactions by attending events, participating in polls, or contributing to chats. It can also display on their profile page. 

**Personalized Matching based on Interests**

- Users can be matched one-to-one based on interests, goals, or hobbies. This matching system could detail user profile, their interests, and goals.

**Group Polling and Voting**
- Groups and communities can create live polls during or after events to ask for opinions or vote on upcoming activities, allowing users to stay involved/increase participation. 

**Sign up for Events - Chat created for people going for events**
- Once users sign up for an event, a chat group is automatically created. This allows them to introduce themselves, plan logistics, or share excitement. 

**Chat/feed  within a Specific Community**
- Each event or community has its own chat or feed where members can post updates, share photos, and discuss topics related to that group. A feed allows users to feel more connected online, and helps onboard new members to see what type of events are hosted. 

**Organize Events based off of other events recommendations**
- Users can suggest or host events based on popular previous events. 

**Personalized Event Matching**
- When the user is filling out the form to identify their interests, preferences and inspiration like filling out questionnaires or selecting from a range of options that they would like to participate in. 

**Collaboration with Multiple Communities**
- Communities within the same location, or similar interests can collaborate to host larger, combined events that appeal to a broader audience, enabling more opportunities to meet various interests. 

**Verified Hosts and Event Creators**
- Event hosts who consistently run successful events, well-reviewed events can apply for or earn badges. This gives users credibility and ensures new users the event will be well-organized. 

**Achievement based badges**
- Users can earn badges by attending events, completing challenges, and interacting with others. These badges help reflect their level of activity within communities. 

**Post Event Feedback** 
- After an event happens, users can leave feedback, rate the hosts, or share their event experience which helps improve future events.

**Community Wide Events Calender**
- A shared calender that allows users to see all upcoming events in their community, helping them plan and discover activities that match their interests.

**Mood Based Event Suggestions**
- This feature could create a mood based input system where users can indicate their mood which matches them to certain events they can participate in.

**Time Capsule for Memories**
- After an event, users can create a “time capsule” function that is filled with photos, videos and can be revisited on a date in the future, which the user will receive a notification about, or similarly a user can upload pictures to a personal “time capsule”. 

**Spontaneous Meetups**
- Based on location, and time of day, a user can indicate their immediate interest to attend similar types of events, and create more informal meetups for users. 

**Event “Wingman”**
- If users feel nervous about attending an event alone, they can request a person interested in attending the same event to go with (and can be based on personal preferences). 

**Surprise “Me” Mode**
- A user can sign up for an event that is generated based off of two requirements, location and interests. This can encourage users to sign up for events, even if they are unsure what they would like to attend.

**Integrated Map Feature**
- This feature displays the events happening in a map version, where users can see nearby events, people that they befriend, or discounts at local shops/cafes. The app can partner with given shops/cafes to receive discounts that can also be integrated with a reward system.


## **4.VSD Analysis** 

**Insight 1:**

The first observation that I made that can have impactful consequences is the idea of “non targeted use” within the stakeholders prompt. The consequences that can come up for social media apps where one meets a person online, can often lead users to think about safety concerns. My design response would be extending the feedback and badges feature to ensure that users can take part in events, or communities with a verification check on individuals, and a feedback section or reviews for repeated events that allows future users to note that those events are safe.

**Insight 2:**

Another observation that I made refers to "accounting for culture" under the pervasiveness prompt. While users will already benefit from the social interactions they have with other individuals, one aspect that might be missed by the app is how people interact from vastly different backgrounds and cultures. A way to promote this is by introducing a cultural sensitivity badge within the achievement based badges system. Users can earn this by participating in events centered around cultural exchange or inclusivity, helping create a more respectful and aware user community.  



**Insight 3:**

Another observation that I made refers to "variation in human ability" under the stakeholders section which is important when considering how to increase awareness of how accessible certain events are. Some of the features like event radar can include an option to filter events based on accessibility, such as wheelchair-friendly locations, sign language interpreters, or events with sensory-friendly environments. 


**Insight 4:**

The goal of the app is to build friendships but more so, sustain friendships for the long-run. Currently, the app encourages users to attend as many events as they would like– whether that is one or ten events. People enjoy reminiscing best through throwback photos! To further enhance this, there can be a shared time capsule for friends on the app where everyone in a group can contribute to a collection of photos/videos. This can serve as a digital scrapbook, that can be revisited. 


**Insight 5:**

Another observation I made refers to the "value tensions" that might arise between privacy and user engagement. Users may want participate in community events but also value their privacy and be reluctant to share too much personal information especially when locations are turned on. Privacy controls can be made customizable within some features like users profiles, event participation, and interactions. Within the chat/feed of a specific community feature, a user could have the option to participate anonymously or limit their visibility to certain groups, such as a “ghost mode” for public events where users can participate without revealing their identity.
