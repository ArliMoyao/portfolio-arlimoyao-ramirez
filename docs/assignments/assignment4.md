# 2. Data Representation

The link to the data modeling for my EventTagMoodSync concept can be found [here](https://github.com/ArliMoyao/backend-starter/blob/main/server/concepts/tagMoodSync.ts.ts)


The link to the data modeling for my Inviting concept can be found [here](https://github.com/ArliMoyao/backend-starter/blob/main/server/concepts/inviting.ts)

I also made some progress on the RESTful routes for the concepts above which can be found [here](https://github.com/ArliMoyao/backend-starter/blob/main/server/routes.ts)
