# Project Phase 5: Beta Release
November 13, 2024. By Carla, Adriana, Arzy, Arli


## Link to Beta 

## Design Revisions 

- Navigation from Home: instead of vertical try 2 sections that scroll horizontally
- We wanted to include availability boolean for listings and requests in order to filter based on availability of the item in the Home view but still be able to see history of exchanged but it also worked to be a great way to “go back” in case a claimer unclaims the item or the lisiting author can make it available again if the claimer never shows up
- Ensuring that no abusive behavior exists: reporting concept only block user from offering but needed to extend it to also creating a listing. 
- When creating a listing, we want to make it as transparent as possible for the user for the type of food items they can give away which is why we decided to add an additional FAQ page that was not originally in the wireframe. 
- For future implementation, we would like to add notifications so users know whenn their post expires 



## Plan for User Tests
- User that has dietary restrictions and lives in a sustainable community housing group that cook together!, Scheduled for 11/7
- User that is a recent graduate friend from outside college, Scheduled for 11/8
- User that is a family relative and a recent graduate, Scheduled for 11/8


## Task List for User Testing 

| Task Title                | Instruction                                                                 | Rationale                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Filtering a List          | You have a tree nut allergy. Search for cookies and make sure they are ok to consume given the specifications | To understand how easy it is for a user for filter out
| Requesting Items        |   You have a tree nut allergy. How do you search for cookies and make sure they are ok to consume. First check for available listings, then if not found, post a request| We want  to check if the flow of checking what’s listed and then requesting makes sense. Also, in many apps (Depop, Facebook marketplace), requests are done by the post functionality, so Listing might be the first thing the user thinks of.|
|    Reviewing Exchange Experience     | You received an item but it was spoiled. Let other users know about this and review the experience.| Seeing if reviewing or reporting is favored by users in cases of misbehavior.
|History of past exchanges    |You have claimed items from other people, navigate to find your past item exchanges and their details|We want to know if history is easy and intuitive to locate
| Listing items    | You have leftover coconut cake. Create a listing for this item for the other users that might be interested in claiming it.| Testing the instructions. Testing if lister will input allergy information.
More products by same user| Say you’re viewing an item, access the other products that the author might have.| This will be helpful to understand the usability and understanding of the features. This will help us determine if it is something that should be shown with a button that says something like see other users’ listings. Or if they should appear under the product, like suggested.|
