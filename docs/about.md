# About Me: Hello! Hola! 안녕하세요!

![This is a picture of NYC ](assets/images/arli-picture.jpg){:width='300'}

**Name:** Arli Moyao-Ramirez

**Age:** 21

**Major** I study Computer Science and Economics at Wellesley College


**Background** I am interested in making design more accessible to users of different backgrounds. I enjoy learning about all things technology especially when it comes to the intersection of technology, ethics, and the ways it impacts humans. I am particulary interested in the ways AI/ML data is utilized, and how we as indivduals make decisions. My journey in programming began when the spring of my freshman year when I took an Introduction to Programming in Python course. Despite the struggle I felt from taking the class, I knew that this challenge would equip me with the tools to create, and turn many of my ideas into tangible products.
