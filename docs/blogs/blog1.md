# Evaluating Design: Reflection on Notion 
October 23, 2024

Like many other college students, Notion is a great productivity for storing class notes, writing to do lists, keeping track of job applications, and even having a finance tracker. It is a highly customizable workspace that combines notes, databases and project management. It is incredible to the extent that a user can manage their productvitiy all in one place and it should be considered a skill itself just learning how to use Notion. 

In some ways, Notion is not meant for the average user. If you want to learn all there is to learn about Notion, video tutorials can be very long.

It's complexity can also be overwhelming, so a cognitive walkthrough can help analyze the flaws of how users learn how to set up their workspace and features.

[Natalie's](https://natalieschnelle.com/home/notion-research) heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough of Notion with some participants findings indicate that, 

1. Users frequently got lost when trying to complete a task 

2. Users were overwhelmed by too many options 

The app's flexible structure, while powerful, can make it difficult for users to follow a clear path to complete tasks. The non-linear design can make it difficult to immediatley understand how to access or utilize various tools effectively. Notion offers a vast array of features which like emphasized above can be a strength and a weakness. Many users find that an abundance of choices intimidating, leading to a decision paralysis. The important decision that a user needs to make is determinig the features that are essential for their needs, and implementing those in their workflow These insights indicate a need for a more streamlined onboarding process and clearer guidance within the app to help users navigate these complexities.

Another individual, [Natalie](https://nataliecodina.squarespace.com/notion) utilized the cognitive walkthrough method to evaluate Notion's mobile app. They analyzed the difference in utilizing the app vs the website, and found that it has limited functionality for mobile users, it is not beginner-friendly, and there is a large fear of mistakes from users due to the lack of undo options. 

This was one of the tasks utilized in the cognitive walkthrough, 

"As a first time user of Notion, you want to create a new, blank page. Once the page has been made, use [this sample information] to help you create a list of assignments to do for a course you are taking." 

I decided to give this task a try: 


The first step can be done by tapping the '+' icon opening up a new page.

Once the new page is opened, it is a bit unknown how to add a type of list. Unlike other apps like the Notes app it does not automatically pop up with the keyboard because it's feature is not just typing in text.

My next step was tapping the three dots given there weren't many other options that would seem intuitive to do, but instead it just brought me to the settings page.

By tapping the screen, I was brought to a whole range of options including antoher '+' icon that allowed me to add a database. However, given I am not a first-time user, this is where I beleive the user would also have trouble with finding or understanding what functionality they would need.

After retreiving the List database, I was able to click anywhere on it in order to give it a name, and '+' icon to add further

This allows users to add further tagging for their assignments tasklist.

While there is a demonstrated learning curve, Notion has also opened a new type of customizable workspace and productivity app that many users have enjoyed. It has allowed users with different learning styles to tailor their environments according to their needs, making it versatile for a wide range of tools. However, through a heuristic evaluation, we have also seen how its tools can be much harder to navigate on a mobile device.
