# Assignment 1

**Interview Planning Notes**

I have attatched the raw notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OnQPIjzWuRLGWcP7arN_g1hScMbGfCl9BtDwdlr3TEw/edit?usp=sharing) which also include the interview questions, and hunch I explore through these interviews. 

**Interview 1** 



I choose to interview Camillie because she represents a typical social media user in her 20s, with a lifestyle that differs significantly from mine as a college student. She works full-time, and didn’t attend college. I was curious to hear more about how she has maintained, if not created more friendships with the aid of social media. Her day-to-day experience with texting friends, sharing memes, and watching videos coupled with her preference for calling friends when possible, highlights the role that social media has played in keeping the bonds she has through multiple outlets. One particularly insight comment she made was about her transition from using Snapchat to Instagram and Tik Tok for connecting with friends, pointing out that her social habits shifted as her friends moved to different platforms. 

One striking tension that surfaced in our conversation was how social media both enhances and undermines her relationships. On one hand, she shared a story about rekindling a friendship thanks to an Instagram story noting that without the platform, they might not have reconnected. On the other hand, Camillie mentions that some followers only interact passively, observing her posts without engaging directly. This passive connection has contributed to the loss of closeness in some relationships, showing that while social media allows connection to form, it makes relationships feel more distant. Camillie also finds it challenging to build connections outside of her work environment, so she often initiates social interactions with her coworkers by asking for their Instagram handles. Once she follows them, she enjoys discovering "who they are through what they post." A particularly interesting moment from the interview was when she shared that, despite following a friend on Instagram for years, they had lost touch. It wasn't until she posted something on her story that her friend reached out. They've been texting regularly since, and Camillie believes that without social media, this relationship wouldn’t have been rekindled, despite following each other for since high school without much interaction.

This made me wonder if she has fostered any new connections through social media without having met them in person which she said she had through an app called YouBo, and has even gone far as texting and meeting up. Camillie’s experience highlights how social media can spark meaningful connections in more ways than one, and provides a window into the people we choose to follow, but still presents a challenge to maintaining deeper connections. 

**Interview 2** 

Another person that I decided to interview is a family relative Elvia. I was interested in hearing her experience because of the vastly different experience she has on social media as an older individual with a upbringing outside of the US. Elvia’s use of Facebook and WhatsApp has notably impacted her ability to maintain connections with family and friends across distances. Having migrated from a small rural village in Mexico to New York City, Elvia intitally limited social connections aside from her immediate family. Social media, particularly Facebook, has allowed her to reconnect with family members she lost touch with and keep up with their lives more easily. She appreciates Facebook for its ability to show updates about family members’ lives without needing to make direct calls, which was especially valuable before she was active on social media. Her use of Whatsapp also streamlined communication with family in Mexico, making it simpler compared to the costly international phone calls she used to rely on. 

A surprising element of the interview is Elvia's preference for traditional communication methods like phone calls, despite her use of social media. Although she finds social media useful for keeping in touch, she still values direct phone calls, particularly for speaking with family members who are not as adept with technology as those display “real connection behind the screen”. This highlights an interesting dynamic where social media has enhanced her connectivity in some ways but not others. For example, she is able to see family members share videos/pictures and generally memories that she did not have growing up, or was able to share. Additionally, the interview reveals another aspect of social media's impact: while it has facilitated reconnections and maintained relationships, it has also exposed limitations, such as older family members' infrequent use of social media, which sometimes hinders more regular interaction. Overall, Elvia's experiences illustrate both the benefits and challenges of social media in bridging distances and preserving relationships.

**Design Opportunities** 
- One idea is exploring innovative non-verbal communication methods that goes beyond traditional text or image-based interactions. Camillie’s shift from “snapping” people to sending and receiving “reels” demonstrates an opportunity for more dynamic, multimedia communication. I believe there is potential to explore more communication styles that aren’t necessarily words, making it more accessible to a broad range of users and engages users in movement, sound, or visual storytelling for more expressive communication. 

-  Another area of interest could be how to further social media tools that facilitate deeper emotional connections. Both interviewees demonstrationed a need to call others to feel connected, which indicate an enhancement of the emotional quality of interactions. This could include creative tools that helps users express themselves more fully and authentically. 

- Finally, a tool that engages users to make and foster new connections through activity and event integration that allows users meet through shared experience regardless of age, racial/ethinic background or languages spoken. There is a saying that many people believe that it only becomes harder to make new friends and maintain those connections after college, despite more social media applications being present than ever.
